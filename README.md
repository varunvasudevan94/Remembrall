<h1>You are forgeting something right now!!!</h1>

Often we forget things, either misplacing or just failing to recollect where we kept the article. 

This App draws inspiration from Harry potter - [Remembrall](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrall).

# About the App
The App enables you to take a photo save it on the device.  
(We don't want your photos or data. Your privacy is of utmost importance!!!!).  
We would periodically send you reminders as to what you are going to forget.  

# Workflow
ITS A THREE STEP PROCESS
1. Keep your wallet(or something you are about to forget) in some place
2. Take out the App and point it to your wallet
3. Voila!!! forget peacefully now

We will send you periodic notifications based on your priorities for the thing you are about to forget

# Plan
I am trying out the project primarily to improve my skills for planning and executing. Also to try out new things and solve the problem faced by millions if not billion.  

I'll be adding the enhancements in stages just to checkpoint the progress-  
1. V1 - Would include bare minimum features to release the App - auth, minimal workflow for capturing image and notifications.
2. V2 - Enhancing UI, providing geo location support and other advance features

I won't be releasing any more versions after V2, I believe everything could be covered in between. 
Rest all the changes will lie in the minor upgrades.  

Will use continuos integration and test driven development (I am bad at this, but like the philosophy)

# Tech Stack
